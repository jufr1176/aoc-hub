                Age of Conquest (abbreviated by and known officially as AOC)
                is a growing community on Discord run by Cristi (seized power
                August 2024 - present.) First established in mid-February of
                2023, it has suffered through a series of separations and
                successions that have created a political division among its
                population. 
                <br><br>
                Today, the people of AOC are decently united
                despite its rough history. Drawing its origins from the small .IO
                game entitled Pixelplace, AOC has conquered more leisurely
                mediums, one of which being Minecraft. AOC has been notably
                suffering through an immigration crisis of Yggdrasil's people in recent months, creating a
                diversity never seen before in the community and sparking lots of nativism in older members. It
                is ranked one of the most xenophobic communities on Discord by various sources, and is known
                to be drastically high in hate speech levels (particularly among Northern AOC members.)

                <br>
                Prior to the creation of AOC, many founding members (including Jack f.k.a. Tiuihyyf, Danke, Cristi
                f.k.a. Ilikemen, and Deserted f.k.a. Ez1on) commonly interacted on the Pixelplace canvas Drew Durnil
                Discord Map. After months of suffering through problems such as griefing and dotting (which
                were fairly common on public canvases in which anyone could draw,) the creation of a private
                and moderated canvas was proposed.
                <br><br>
                Picture on the left is a screenshot of the 1984 map canvas, taken by Danke.
                In January 2023, PxP user James created the canvas 1984 map
                and advertised it to various hotspots on the game, including the
                Drew Durnil canvas. Attracting Danke, Ilikemen (Cristi), and
                Tiuihyyf (Jackson) later on, this canvas is ultimately agreed to be
                the first predecessor of AOC. This canvas also had
                contributions from AOC founder Naple, and other recurring individuals such as Dubya and
                Maxus201. The canvas had significant player engagement, and lasted for a good two weeks.
                Picture on the right is a screenshot of the first season of A New World Age, also taken by Danke.
                <br><br>
                After Naple and James destroyed the canvas, James’s funding
                sport Agrapefruit succeeded the 1984 map canvas with A New
                World Age, attracting almost the same demographic and barely
                lasting for 3 seasons. At this point, patterns of alliances and
                rivalries were beginning to emerge and make themself quite
                repetitive. This would set the basis of the users’ relations during
                the first couple of AOC canvases.
                <br><br>
                Picture on the left, Age of Empires, taken by Danke.
                After ANWA, Maxus201 would follow with the last AOC
                predecessor, Age of Empires, in the very early February of 2023.
                It lasted for a couple weeks, before it was abandoned after
                Maxus abused mod tools, supposedly in a fit of rage after losing
                a war. People from there, which included some new members,
                started a rebellion with Naple, resulting in the creation of the
                very first canvas under Age of Conquest.
